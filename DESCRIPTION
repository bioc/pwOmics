Description: pwOmics performs pathway-based level-specific data
    comparison of matching omics data sets based on pre-analysed
    user-specified lists of differential genes/transcripts and
    phosphoproteins. A separate downstream analysis of phosphoproteomic 
    data including pathway identification, transcription factor 
    identification and target gene identification is opposed to 
    the upstream analysis starting with gene or transcript information 
    as basis for identification of upstream transcription factors 
    and potential proteomic regulators. The
    cross-platform comparative analysis allows for comprehensive
    analysis of single time point experiments and time-series
    experiments by providing static and dynamic analysis tools for
    data integration. In addition, it provides functions to identify
    individual signaling axes based on data integration.
