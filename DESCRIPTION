Description: pwOmics performs pathway-based level-specific data
        comparison of matching omics data sets based on pre-analysed
        user-specified lists of differential genes/transcripts and
        proteins. A separate downstream analysis of proteomic data
        including pathway identification and enrichment analysis,
        transcription factor identification and target gene
        identification is opposed to the upstream analysis starting
        with gene or transcript information as basis for identification
        of upstream transcription factors and regulators. The
        cross-platform comparative analysis allows for comprehensive
        analysis of single time point experiments and time-series
        experiments by providing static and dynamic analysis tools for
        data integration.
